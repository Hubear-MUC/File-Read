File Read 0.2
-------------

Reads in the first 10 bytes of the content of the file

  d.d

and prints it out on the terminal.

The program just needs to be invoked.

Because the program does not read in the complete file but only the first
10 bytes the version number will be minor, thus 0.2

There was no code space left to implement some error handling in case the
file is too big for the array z, also not for manual memory allocation.


Changes:
--------

Version 0.2

The code was restructured to make it readable more clearly.
Before everything of code for providing the results was placed in one single
line.


Version 0.1

Initial version
